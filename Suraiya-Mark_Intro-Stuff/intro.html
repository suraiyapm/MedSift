        My name is Suraiya Poberezhsky Mark. I'm currently a senior at Brooklyn College, and majoring in Computer Science.
        I've primarily been using Java in classes, with a bit of familiarity with HTML and CSS from previous experiences.
        I've also used a small amount of basic JavaScript when taking part in an accelerated programming workshop a few
        years ago. Though I've worked on programs and database-related things before, and some limited web development, I've
        never really worked on a project similar to what we are going to be working on as a group for this class, involving
        putting all these separate things together for a functional, efficient web application.
        <br>
        Regarding career aspirations, I'm open to beginning anywhere within the field upon graduation from this program,
        though I do have a particular interest in software engineering, and I would like to explore this further. Additionally,
        I would be interested in delving into more audio-engineering-related programming, as I've never done this before, but
        regularly use DAWs, such as FL Studio. I've been enjoying the major as I continuously learn enough to be able to
        do more, and I am excited to enter the field.
