# 3140_Project
## Placeholder Team Name: MedReader Team(?)
## Member Roles:
[Suraiya P. Mark](https://github.com/suraiyapm/3140_Project/tree/main/Suraiya-Mark_Intro-Stuff) -potentially front-end dev  
[Rabia Rehmein](https://github.com/suraiyapm/3140_Project/tree/main/Rabia_Rehmein_Intro) -potentially design, testing/db  
[Francis Harbourt](https://github.com/suraiyapm/3140_Project/blob/main/Francis_Harbourt_Intro/intro.html) -potentially back-end dev  

## Project Idea:
The project will, in appearance, be similar to Scrivener, but the core functionality will be focused on organizing an entire topic of research in one place.
It will be focused around medical or scientific research, and have spaces for notes, keeping track of ongoing feeds, and make it easy to compile different
resources in one place. This idea is potentially not set in stone, in which case I will alter this file accordingly.
Here is a (VERY rough) draft/outline for what this may look like:

## Repo Structure:
(One potential format we may have)
We'll have separate folders for the HTML introductions, and then a project folder.
In the actual project folder, we'll maybe have client/ for front-end, server/ for back-end, database/, and maybe a separate docs/ area for documentation about the project.
I'd like to thoroughly set up several relative links in the future extended version of the project README, for organization and ease of access, and readability.
