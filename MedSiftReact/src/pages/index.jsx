//This is just a collection of all of the exported components from the src/pages file.
//It makes it easier to import them into other files within our app
//ex. import { Journals, Home, Notes, Dashboard, About} from "./pages";
//rather than having to write many seperate import lines. 

export { default as Journals } from "./Journals";
export { default as Home } from "./Home";
export { default as Notes } from "./Notes";
export { default as Dashboard } from "./Dashboard";
export { default as About } from "./About";
export { default as Register } from "./Register";
export { default as Login } from "./Login";
